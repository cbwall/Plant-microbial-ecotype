Our project tested the influence of microbial communities on plant performance and how "home advantages" and environmental pressures alter plant-microbe interactions across a water resource gradient in Waimea Valley on the north shore of O'ahu, Hawai'i. We used the inoculum sources from the natural elevation-precipitation gradient (low, medium, high precipitation soil inocula) in a factorial design experiment where plants were exposed to collected soil inocula and subjected to varying watering regimes. To accompish this, we used axenically cloned model plant system (strawberry, *Fragaria virginiana*) grown in sterile soil, inoculated with soil slurries from each of those sites, and subjected plants to reciprocal water treatments imposed at three levels of watering (dry, moderate, wet) based on the average precipitation of the inoculum source environment.  
  
## File Directory  
The file directory contains folders and scripts (Rmd) to be run in RStudio. The folders house data, output, and raw + polished figures    
   - *Plant.microbial.ecotype.Rproj* = the R project for the analysis, load this first to allow code to run from correct directory in R Studio  
   - *Plant.microbial.ecotype.Rmd* = the scripts and annotated code chunks here will walk through analyses and produce outputs  
   - *Plant.microbial.ecotype.html* = the knit output of the Rmd file. Open this in any browser  
 
   - Folders  
     - *data* = contains raw and processed data files  
     - *figures* = contains raw exported figures from code (main text and Appendix 1  
     - *output* = contains the *scape.data.csv* file, used in generating isoscopes on x-y point system  

## Metadata
Important data files to generate figures and run models can be found in the *data folder*. The key data files are:
