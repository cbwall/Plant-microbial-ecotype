Our project tested the influence of microbial communities on plant performance and how "home advantages" and environmental pressures alter plant-microbe interactions across a water resource gradient in Waimea Valley on the north shore of O'ahu, Hawai'i. We used the inoculum sources from the natural elevation-precipitation gradient (low, medium, high precipitation soil inocula) in a factorial design experiment where plants were exposed to collected soil inocula and subjected to varying watering regimes. To accompish this, we used axenically cloned model plant system (strawberry, *Fragaria virginiana*) grown in sterile soil, inoculated with soil slurries from each of those sites, and subjected plants to reciprocal water treatments imposed at three levels of watering (dry, moderate, wet) based on the average precipitation of the inoculum source environment.
